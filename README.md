# Everything Project REST API

This is the REST/GraphQL API for the Everything Project. Initially, data will be hardcoded at this layer in order to satisfy the front-end. As the project develops, the data will gradually move to the [Everything Project Data layer](https://github.com/dale-chang91/everything-project-data).

In order to contribute, please pull this project and follow the same Git branching convention as indicated in the [Everything Project UX](https://github.com/dale-chang91/everything-project). An example of the Git branch breakout can be seen below
